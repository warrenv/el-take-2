Our code is organized such that some of the repositories are included as submodules in others.
Since we update these dependencies regularly, itâ€™s important to keep them updated in the
repositories that use them.

Given a submodule named 'content', please implement a solution to create a GitHub pull
request which updates the version of that submodule to the latest commit on its 'main' branch.
Your solution should run on a regular schedule and also automatically add a set of GitHub users
as reviewers on the pull request.
